# Writing a C Compiler in Rust

This is my attempt at writing a C compiler, guided by the book [Writing a C Compiler](https://norasandler.com/book/)
by Nora Sandler, Second printing (2024).

I am implementing the compiler in Rust. The initial 'driver' implementation is in Python, for now.

I started this project in March 2025, purely for fun.
